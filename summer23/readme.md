## Description
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for plotting functions. These scripts are designed to assist students in Exp2 with visualizing mathematical functions. Specifically, it uses the functions from exercise 10.3 of the Exp2 course at KIT in summer 2023.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:
- Python 3

### Running the Script
To plot functions using the provided Python script, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.\
3. Run the following command:\

python3 plot_blatt10.py

4. The script will generate the plots and display them on the screen.

That's it! You should now be able to plot functions using the provided Python script. \
